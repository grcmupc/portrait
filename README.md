# DQN-MARL Capacity sharing solution

##WARNING: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY DRAFT - THE COMPLETE VERSION WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE END OF JULY 2022

Welcome to the Gihub repository of the DQN-MARL capacity sharing solution, a solution for dynamically distributing the capacity in multiple NG-RAN nodes among multiple tenants, each of them provided with a RAN slice. The capacity sharing is performed so that the traffic demands and Service Level Agreement (SLA) of the different tenant are satisfied and the resources in the different NG-RAN nodes are efficiently used. A detailed description of the operation of the DQN-MARL capacity sharing solution has been published in our paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9497684

Current development of the solution focuses on a Proof of Concept (PoC) of this solution, which is included in the PORTRAIT project.
